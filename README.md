Work in progress.
This project aims at using enterprise technologies such as Struts2 with server-side rendering to create my personal website, to get my hands on server-side MVC.

TODO :
- Define a Postgres database structure and connect it to the app through Hibernate
- Set up simple views with Struts2 forms to save some data
