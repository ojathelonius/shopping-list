# Shopping list

Implementing a shopping list Java web app, which will allow the household to let me know what we have to buy next time we get groceries.

TODO :
- Define a Postgres database structure and connect it to the app through Hibernate
- Set up simple views with Struts2 forms to save some data
- Eventually the app will also be connected to Dialogflow to make adding items easier with Google Assistant.
