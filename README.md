Working on my own website using recent technologies such as Struts2.

TODO :
- Define a Postgres database structure and connect it to the app through Hibernate
- Set up simple views with Struts2 forms to save some data
- Eventually the app will also be connected to Dialogflow to make adding items easier with Google Assistant.
